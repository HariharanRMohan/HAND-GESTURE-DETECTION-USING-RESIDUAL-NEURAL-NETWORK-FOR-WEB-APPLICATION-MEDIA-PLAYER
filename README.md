# Hand-Gesture-Detection-Using-Residual-Neural-Network-For-Web-Application-Media-Player
In linguistics, hand gestures are an important part of body language. When compared to the devices stated earlier, they have a more natural interface. The use of the hand as a device facilitates human-computer interaction. Interaction would be more fascinating if hand gestures were used to operate the machine. Gesture recognition has become increasingly important. Hand gestures are used to operate a variety of applications such as Windows Media Player, robot control, and gaming, among others. Gestures make interaction simple and convenient, and they do not require the use of any additional devices. It is possible to combine vision and audio recognition. Gesture recognition is a method of interpreting and analyzing human body language to communicate with the user appropriately. This, in turn, aids in the creation of a communication bridge between the machine and the user. Gesture recognition aids in the processing of data that cannot be transmitted by speech or word. The simplest way to communicate something significant is through gestures. As a result, this project is designed to allow users to operate the online media player like youtube with hand gestures.
